# fmt-doc

This repository contains the source files for the project documentation powered by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

## Getting started

1. Install MkDocs:
   ```bash
   pip install mkdocs
   ```
2. Launch the development server:
   ```bash
   mkdocs serve
   ```

All documentation files reside in the `docs/` directory. Create a new subdirectory for each theme you wish to document.
